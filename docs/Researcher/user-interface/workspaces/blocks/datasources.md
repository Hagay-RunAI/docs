# Data source introduction

The _Data source_ is a non-mandatory building block for the creation of a workspace (See also [Create Data source](create-ds.md)).
 
A data source is a location where data sets relevant to the research are stored. Workspaces can be attached to several data sources for reading and writing. The data can be located locally or in the cloud. Run:ai data sets can use a variety of storage technologies such as Git, S3, NFS, PVC, and more.
