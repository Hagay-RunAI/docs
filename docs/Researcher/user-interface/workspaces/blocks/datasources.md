# Data source introduction

The _Data source_ is a non-mandatory building block for the creation of a workspace (See also [Create Data source](#xxx)). In many cases, it would be the administrator to create the data source but not necessarily. 
 
This data source consists of the data sets relevant to the research (thatâ€™s why a workspace can consist of several data sources). The data source building block is a reference to datasets located at one of many technologies supported by run.ai (E.g Git, S3, NFS, PVC, etc).
