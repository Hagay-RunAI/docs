# Data source introduction

The _Data source_ is a non-mandatory building block for the creation of a workspace (See also [Create Data source](#xxx)).
 
A data source is a location where data sets relevant to the research are stored. Workspaces can consist of several data sources for reading and writing. The data can be located locally or in the cloud. The data source building block is in fact a reference to datasets located at one of many technologies supported by run.ai (E.g Git, S3, NFS, PVC, etc).
