# Data source introduction

Data source is a non-mandatory building block for the creation of a workspace (See also <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Create Data source</span>). In many cases, it would be the administrator to create the data source but not necessarily. \
 \
This data source consists of the data sets relevant to the research (that’s why a workspace can consist of several data sources). Data source building block is in fact a reference to datasets located at one of many technologies supported by run.ai (E.g Git, S3, NFS, PVC, etc).  \

Data source types \


When a data source is created, its scope of relevancy can be set to be of a specific single project (e.g. “Project A”) or of the entire Tennant, which results in scope relevancy of all projects (current projects and also any future ones).

Project selection when creating a data source

In order to reduce noise and increase context, data scientists can view & use only environments that are in their scope of relevancy.
