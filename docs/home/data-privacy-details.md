# Data Privacy  

Run:AI [SaaS Cluster installation](../admin/runai-setup/installation-types.md) uses the Run:AI cloud as its control plane. The cluster sends information to the cloud for the purpose of control as well as dashboards. The document below is a run-down of the data that is being sent to the Run:AI cloud.


!!! Note
    If the data detailed below is not in line with your organization's policy, you can choose to install the Run:AI self-hosted version. The self-hosted installation includes the Run:AI control-plane (also called "backend") and will not communicate with the cloud. The self-hosted installation has different pricing.
