# Overview: Developer Documentation

Developers can access Run:AI through programmatic interfaces. 

As part of the Developer documentation you will find:

* How to authenticate against the Run:AI REST API 
* __Researcher APIs__. You can use APIs to add, delete, and list Jobs. This can be done using the Run:AI [Researcher REST API](researcher-rest-api/overview.md) or by directly accessing [Kubernetes API](k8s-api/overview.md).
* [Administrator REST API](admin-rest-api/overview.md). A set of REST services to add, delete, and list Projects, Departments, Users, etc. 
* [Inference API](inference/overview.md) to deploy inference workloads.
* Use [Metrics API](metrics/metrics.md) to retrieve metric data from Run:AI.
