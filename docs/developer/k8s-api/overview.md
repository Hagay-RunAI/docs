# Overview: Launch a Job via Kubernetes API

You can create, submit, list or delete jobs using the Command-line interface or the Run:AI User Interface. 

To do the same programmatically you can use the Run:AI [Researcher REST API](../researcher-rest-api/overview.md). 

You can also communicate directly with the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure by:
* [Sending YAML files](../k8s-api/launch-job-via-yaml.md) or,
* By using a variety of programming languages to send requests to Kubernetes. See [Submit a Run:AI Job via Kubernetes API](../k8s-api/launch-job-via-kubernetes-api.md) for a python sample.
