# Connect JupyterHub with Run:AI


## Overview

A [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org){target=_blank} is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more. Jupyter Notebooks are popular with Researchers as a way to code and run deep-learning code. 

[JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub){target=_blank} JupyterHub makes it possible to serve a pre-configured data science environments.

This document explains how to set up JupyterHub to integrate with Run:AI such that Notebooks spawned via JuptyerHub will use resources scheduled by Run:AI

If you wish to connect to a __local__ Jupyter Notebook inside a container, see [Using a Jupyter Notebook within a Run:AI Job](../../Researcher/tools/dev-jupyter.md) 


## Installing JupyterHub

This document follows the JupyterHub [installation documentation](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jupyterhub/installation.html){target=_blank}

Create a namespace, by running:

```
kubectl create namespace jhub
```

Provide access roles:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-ai/docs/master/install/jupyterhub/jhubroles.yaml
```

JupyterHub requires storage in the form of a PersistentVolume (PV). For __an example__ of a _local_ PV:

* Download [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-ai/docs/master/install/jupyterhub/pv-example.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-ai/docs/master/install/jupyterhub/pv-example.yaml){target=_blank} 
* Replace <NODE-NAME> with one of your worker nodes. 
* The Example PV refers to `/srv/jupyterhub`. Log on to the node and run `chmod 777 -R /srv/jupyterhub`

Then run:

```
kubectl apply -f pv-example.yaml 
```

The JupyterHub installation creates a _PersistentVolumeClaim_ named `hub-db-dir` that should be refered to by the PV.

Create a configuration file for JupyterHub. An example configuration file for Run:AI can be found in [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-ai/docs/master/install/jupyterhub/config.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-ai/docs/master/install/jupyterhub/config.yaml){target=_blank}. It contains 3 JupyterHub configuration. 

Download the file and replace <SECRET-TOKEN> with a random number generated by running `openssl rand -hex 32
`

Run:

``` bash 
helm repo add jupyterhub https://jupyterhub.github.io/helm-chart/
helm repo update
helm install jhub jupyterhub/jupyterhub -n jhub --values config.yaml
```

## Access JupyterHub

Run:

```
kubectl get service -n jhub proxy-public
```

Use the `External IP` of the service to access the service.


Login with Run:AI Project name as user name.
