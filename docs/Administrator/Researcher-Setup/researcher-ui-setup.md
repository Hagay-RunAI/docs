# Researcher User Interface

The Run:AI Researcher User Interface allows Researchers which are less experienced with a command-line interface to view Projects, as well as submit and view Jobs.

!!! Important
    * The Run:AI Researcher User Interface is currently in __beta__.
    * The Run:AI Researcher User Interface does not work when the [system is configured to authenticate Researchers](../Cluster-Setup/researcher-authentication.md). We are working to add this functionality.
